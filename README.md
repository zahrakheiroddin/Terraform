The structure of a Terraform project is designed to organize the configuration files, modules, variables, and state files in a clear and maintainable way. Here's an overview of a typical Terraform project structure:

### **1. Basic Terraform Project Structure:**

```bash
.
├── main.tf             # Main configuration file for resources and providers
├── variables.tf        # Variable declarations (optional)
├── outputs.tf          # Output values (optional)
├── terraform.tfvars    # Values for the variables (optional)
├── provider.tf         # Provider configurations (optional)
├── data.tf             # Data sources (optional)
└── terraform.tfstate   # State file (generated after apply)
```

#### **File Details:**

1. **`main.tf`:**
   - This is the primary file where most of your infrastructure is defined. It contains the resources, modules, and general configurations.
   
   Example:
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_instance" "example" {
     ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
     instance_type = "t2.micro"
   }
   ```

2. **`variables.tf`:**
   - This file defines input variables that you can use to parameterize your configurations. Variables make your configuration more flexible and reusable.

   Example:
   ```hcl
   variable "instance_type" {
     description = "Type of EC2 instance"
     default     = "t2.micro"
   }
   ```

3. **`outputs.tf`:**
   - This file defines the output values that Terraform will return after running the configuration. Output values can be helpful to access information like the public IP of an EC2 instance or IDs of resources.

   Example:
   ```hcl
   output "instance_public_ip" {
     value = aws_instance.example.public_ip
   }
   ```

4. **`terraform.tfvars`:**
   - This file contains values for the variables defined in `variables.tf`. It allows you to set specific values without hardcoding them into your configuration files.

   Example:
   ```hcl
   instance_type = "t3.medium"
   ```

5. **`provider.tf`:**
   - This file declares the providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) you’ll use in your project. Providers allow Terraform to interact with cloud platforms.

   Example:
   ```hcl
   provider "aws" {
     region = "us-west-2"
   }
   ```

6. **`data.tf`:**
   - This file is used to define data sources, which allow you to fetch information from existing resources that are not managed by your Terraform configuration but are part of your infrastructure.

   Example:
   ```hcl
   data "aws_ami" "example" {
     most_recent = true
     owners      = ["amazon"]

     filter {
       name   = "name"
       values = ["amzn2-ami-hvm-*"]
     }
   }
   ```

7. **`terraform.tfstate` and `terraform.tfstate.backup`:**
   - These files track the current state of the infrastructure managed by Terraform. They are automatically generated and updated whenever you run `terraform apply` or `terraform plan`.
   - The state file helps Terraform know which resources it manages and their current state.

   **Note:** These should **not** be modified manually.

### **2. Advanced Terraform Project Structure (with Modules):**

For larger projects, Terraform supports modular structures, where configurations are organized into smaller, reusable components (modules). A more advanced Terraform project might look like this:

```bash
.
├── main.tf                  # Main file to orchestrate the entire infrastructure
├── variables.tf             # Variable definitions
├── outputs.tf               # Output values
├── terraform.tfvars         # Variable values
├── provider.tf              # Provider definitions (e.g., AWS, Azure)
├── modules/
│   ├── ec2/
│   │   ├── main.tf          # EC2 module configuration
│   │   ├── variables.tf     # EC2-specific variables
│   │   ├── outputs.tf       # EC2-specific outputs
│   └── vpc/
│       ├── main.tf          # VPC module configuration
│       ├── variables.tf     # VPC-specific variables
│       └── outputs.tf       # VPC-specific outputs
└── terraform.tfstate        # Terraform state file
```

#### **Module Folder Structure:**

- **Modules Directory (`/modules`):**
  - **Modules** are reusable pieces of Terraform code. You can place modules in a `/modules` folder and call them in your `main.tf` file or elsewhere.
  - Each module typically contains its own `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf` files to define its resources, inputs, and outputs.

  Example Module `main.tf` for an EC2 instance:
  ```hcl
  resource "aws_instance" "ec2_instance" {
    ami           = var.ami_id
    instance_type = var.instance_type

    tags = {
      Name = var.instance_name
    }
  }
  ```

---

### **3. Common Supporting Files:**

- **`.gitignore`:**
  If you're using version control (like Git), you should use a `.gitignore` file to exclude sensitive files (like `terraform.tfstate`, which can contain sensitive information).
  ```bash
  .terraform/
  terraform.tfstate
  terraform.tfstate.backup
  ```

- **`terraform.lock.hcl`:**
  This file is automatically generated by Terraform and ensures that the same provider versions are used in your project. You should commit this file to version control.

---

### **4. Remote State Management (Optional):**

For collaborative environments, Terraform state is often stored in remote backends like S3 or Azure Blob Storage. Here’s an example of setting up an S3 backend for Terraform state:

**`backend.tf`:**

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key            = "path/to/my/statefile.tfstate"
    region         = "us-west-2"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock"
  }
}
```

This ensures that the state is stored in a remote bucket, which is helpful for teams and for preventing local state file conflicts.

---

### **Summary of Files:**

- **`main.tf`:** Defines the primary infrastructure resources.
- **`variables.tf`:** Declares input variables for the configuration.
- **`outputs.tf`:** Specifies output values that can be used later.
- **`provider.tf`:** Declares which cloud or service provider Terraform will use.
- **`data.tf`:** Fetches external data sources from the provider.
- **`terraform.tfvars`:** Contains variable values used in the configuration.
- **`modules/`:** Houses reusable infrastructure components (e.g., EC2, VPC modules).
- **`terraform.tfstate`:** Tracks the current state of the resources.

This structure allows you to create modular, maintainable, and scalable Terraform projects.

# Terraform AWS EC2 Example

This repository contains a basic Terraform configuration for provisioning an AWS EC2 instance along with a security group. It demonstrates how to use Terraform to manage AWS infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) installed
- AWS account and credentials set up (use `aws configure` to set up your credentials)
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed (optional, but useful for managing your AWS environment)

## Usage

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/terraform-aws-ec2-example.git
cd terraform-aws-ec2-example
```

### 2. Initialize Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
```

This will download the necessary provider plugins.

### 3. Apply the configuration:

```bash
terraform apply
```

You will be prompted to confirm the changes. Type `yes` to provision the EC2 instance and security group in AWS.

### 4. Verify the resources in the AWS Console:

Go to the [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and verify that the EC2 instance and security group have been created.

### 5. Destroy the resources:

When you are done, run the following command to clean up the resources:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Terraform Configuration

Below is the Terraform code used to create an AWS EC2 instance and a security group:

```hcl
# Configure the AWS provider
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

# Create a security group to allow SSH and HTTP
resource "aws_security_group" "example_sg" {
  name        = "terraform-example-sg"
  description = "Allow SSH and HTTP traffic"
  
  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

# Create an EC2 instance
resource "aws_instance" "example_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  security_groups = [aws_security_group.example_sg.name]

  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform-Example-Instance"
  }
}
```


2. **Push the changes:**
   ```sh
   git push
   ```
